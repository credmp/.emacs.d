Micro-optimizations are super fun.\r\nThese are used in the [Emacs Rocks](http://emacsrocks.com) screencasts.\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\nTo grab all the dependencies, either:\r\n\r\n    git clone git://github.com/credmp/.emacs.d.git\r\n    cd .emacs.d\r\n    git submodule init\r\n    git submodule update\r\n\r\nor on git v1.6.5 or later:\r\n\r\n    git clone --recursive git://github.com/credmp/.emacs.d.git\r\n\r\nThe first time you start emacs, it will install some additional packages\r\nthat are best handled by the package manager.\r\n\r\n## Install emacs on mac\r\n\r\nI use a pre-built binary from:\r\n    \r\n    http://emacsformacosx.com/\r\n\r\nYou can also use Cocoa Emacs, installed like this:\r\n\r\n    brew install emacs --cocoa\r\n\r\nYou can also get the very latest Emacs:\r\n\r\n    brew install emacs --cocoa --use-git-head --HEAD\r\n\r\nTo open it with Alfred or Quicksilver, you have to copy `Emacs.app` into\r\n`/Applications` instead of the symlink that brew places there.\r\n\r\n## Modifications in this repository\r\n\r\nI forked the repository from [Magnars](https://github.com/magnars/.emacs.d).\r\n\r\nThe changes I made are in the following areas:\r\n\r\n### Java editing\r\n\r\nI added support for [Eclim](http://eclim.org/) / [Emacs-Eclim](https://github.com/senny/emacs-eclim). \r\n\r\n * `C-x C-o ja` - Open java file in current project\r\n * `C-x C-o a` - Open any file in current project\r\n\r\nI also integrated the yasnippets from [nekop's java-mode yasnippets](https://github.com/nekop/yasnippet-java-mode) and \r\nadjusted the package `pa` snippet to work correctly for Maven projects.\r\n\r\n### Org-Mode editing\r\n\r\nSupport for org-mode editing was also added.\r\n\r\n## Tips for using these emacs settings\r\n\r\nIf you want to use my settings straight out of the box, here are some things to note:\r\n\r\n * The key bindings are optimized for a norwegian keyboard layout.\r\n\r\n * Start by reading up on all the cool stuff in key-bindings.el.\r\n\r\n * You quit emacs with `C-x r q`, mnemonic *Really Quit*.\r\n\r\n * Find file in project with `C-x o`, in dir with `C-x C-f`, recent with `C-x f`\r\n\r\n * Add your user- and project-specific stuff in .emacs.d/users/[machine name]/*.el\r\n\r\n * Autocomplete with `C-.`\r\n\r\n * expand-region is your friend. Find its bound key by doing `F1 f er/expand-region`\r\n\r\n * annoying-arrows suggests alternative ways of moving around if you use the\r\n   arrow keys excessively.\r\n\r\n * Undo with `C-_` and redo with `M-_`. Watch the undo-tree with `C-x u`\r\n\r\n * Easily add functions to the F-keys with `M-: (f5 <sexps here>)`, example `(f5 (flush-lines \"console.log\"))`\r\n\r\n * Quickly jump anywhere in the buffer by pressing `fn` plus the starting letter of a word.\r\n\r\n * Indent and clean up white space in the entire buffer with `C-c n`\r\n\r\n * On a mac, the Meta key `M` is bound to Command.\r\n\r\n * Watch [emacsrocks.com](http://emacsrocks.com) for a lot of good pointers\r\n\r\n### Files\r\n\r\n* `C-x C-f` Open a file. Starts in the current directory\r\n* `C-x f  ` Open a recently visited file\r\n* `C-x o  ` Open a file in the current project (based on .git ++)\r\n* `C-x C-s` Save this file\r\n* `C-x C-w` Save as ...\r\n* `C-x C-j` Jump to this files' current directory\r\n* `C-x b  ` Switch to another open file (buffer)\r\n* `C-x C-b` List all open files (buffers)\r\n\r\n### Cut copy and paste\r\n\r\n* `C-space` Start marking stuff. C-g to cancel.\r\n* `C-w    ` Cut (aka kill)\r\n* `C-k    ` Cut till end of line\r\n* `M-w    ` Copy\r\n* `C-y    ` Paste (aka yank)\r\n* `M-y    ` Cycle last paste through previous kills\r\n* `C-x C-y` Choose what to paste from previous kills\r\n* `C-@    ` Mark stuff quickly. Press multiple times\r\n\r\n### General\r\n\r\n* `C-g    ` Quit out of whatever mess you've gotten yourself into\r\n* `M-x    ` Run a command by name\r\n* `C-.    ` Autocomplete\r\n* `C-_    ` Undo\r\n* `M-_    ` Redo\r\n* `C-x u  ` Show the undo-tree\r\n* `C-x m  ` Open magit. It's a magical git interface for emacs\r\n\r\n### Navigation\r\n\r\n* `C-arrow` Move past words/paragraphs\r\n* `C-a    ` Go to indentation, then start of line\r\n* `C-e    ` Go to end of line\r\n* `M-g M-g` Go to line number\r\n* `C-x C-i` Go to symbol\r\n* `C-s    ` Search forward. Press `C-s` again to go further.\r\n* `C-r    ` Search backward. Press `C-r` again to go further.\r\n\r\n### Window management\r\n\r\n* `C-x 0  ` Close this window\r\n* `C-x 1  ` Close other windows\r\n* `C-x 2  ` Split window horizontally\r\n* `C-x 3  ` Split window vertically\r\n* `S-arrow` Jump to window to the left/right/up/down\r\n\r\n"}
